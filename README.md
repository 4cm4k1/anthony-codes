This is the code for my personal website located at [anthony.codes](https://anthony.codes).

If you happen to like it or find anything interesting, feel free to bring the code down onto your system.

Anything amiss? Shoot me a PR! ðŸ‘Š

It uses [AngularJS 2](https://github.com/angular), [Angular Material 2](https://github.com/material2), [AngularFire 2](https://github.com/firebase/angularfire2), and [Firebase](https://github.com/firebase). It's live, deployed via Firebase Hosting and the Firebase CLI.

## Install

### Clone with HTTPS

```shell
git clone https://github.com/4cm4k1/anthony-codes.git
npm install || yarn install
```

### Clone with SSH

## Usage

### Deploy with Firebase Hosting

Assuming you have `firebase-tools` installed, you can deploy by (1) initializing -- this will create the `.firebaserc` file; you will need to change the `package.json`'s `name` property to something other than `anthony-codes` -- and then (2) deploying. This will create the `database.rules.json` and `firebase.json` files as well as deploy your website live to `<your-package-name>.firebaseapp.com`. _See Firebase's docs for more information on configuring the created files._

```shell
firebase init
firebase deploy
```

### Develop Locally

#### npm

```shell
npm start -> ng serve
```

#### Yarn

```shell
yarn run start -> ng serve
```
