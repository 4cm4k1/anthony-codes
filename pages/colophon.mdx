I’m using this opportunity to experiment with some of the latest technologies—some new to me, some not—such as [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), and [Material Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-react). The features include or will soon include:

- [Immediate builds and deployments to Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/now) from [commits to GitHub](https://zeit.co/blog/every-push-now), leveraging [Docker](https://zeit.co/blog/serverless-docker) and [Cloudflare](https://zeit.co/blog/now-cdn) to reduce instance response time worldwide _**(live)**_
- [Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) with nonces, Feature Policy,](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) and [HTTP security headers](https://securityheaders.com/?q=anthony.codes&followRedirects=on) to limit attack surface _**(live)**_
- [Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](https://zeit.co/docs/examples/next#deploying-a-server-rendered-next.js-app) to increase rendering performance, reduce roundtrips, provide gracefully degraded experience for users who disable JavaScript, and ensure consistent SEO _**(live)**_
- [Markdown mixed with JSX](https://mdxjs.com/) for static pages [(including this one)](https://github.com/4cm4k1/website/blob/master/pages/index.mdx) and a future blog _**(live)**_
- [Structured Data via JSON-LD](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/#url=https%3A%2F%2Fanthony.codes) which will eventually result in richer content in search results _**(live)**_
- [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://hstspreload.org/?domain=anthony.codes) with [certificates auto-generated by LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) using TLS 1.3 and other standards to [give users trusted connection with authentic source](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=anthony.codes&latest) _**(live)**_
- [Compression](https://github.com/Alorel/shrink-ray) with [`brotli` format](https://github.com/google/brotli) to further reduce page weight _**(live)**_
- [Progressive Web Application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) to enable offline use and near-native user experience across many platforms _**(live)**_
- [Full HTTPS support](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) in local development environment _**(live)**_
- [Caching SSRed responses on the server](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/ssr-caching) to further reduce response time and CPU usage _**(live)**_
- More detailed Google Analytics reporting with Autotrack
- Live feed of my GitHub activity and possibly other data
- Self-implemented commenting system in forthcoming blog
- Logging of Report-URI endpoints and debug logging
- Use of Commitizen and `all-contributors` for better commits and changelogs
