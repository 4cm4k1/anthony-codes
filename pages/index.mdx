Iâ€™m working on some exciting personal projects, which Iâ€™ll post here as theyâ€™re ready. I also use this site as a playground for trying new ideas and technologies, whether itâ€™s serverless lambdas, React, Next.js, or Material Components. Iâ€™ll have a blog up and running here soon covering those efforts. For now, check out my links below:
