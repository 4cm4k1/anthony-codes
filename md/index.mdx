# Hello, I’m Anthony.

I’m rebuilding this website with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), and [Material Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-react). I’m striving to make this a high-performance, standards-compliant progressive web application. Please check back soon.

## About me:

_Currently, I’m seeking full-time employment in front-end and Node.js development, either remotely or physically in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. Contact me with the information in my [résumé](https://anthony.codes/resume-anthony-maki.pdf) below, or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/4cm4k1/)._

I’m an adept, ​mid-level ​software ​engineer ​with ​rich ​front ​and ​back-end ​experience ​across many languages, ​technologies, ​and ​frameworks. ​I have architected, ​implemented, and maintained DevOps ​practices ​and ​CI/CD ​processes ​in ​agile ​startup ​environments. My specialties include React, Angular, jQuery, and native JavaScript front-end development, Node.js application development, and implementation of development tooling and build processes.

My ​passion ​for technology ​started ​as ​latent ​interest ​at ​seven ​years ​old ​when ​I ​failed ​to ​compile ​a ​C++ ​“Hello World” ​program. ​Later ​in ​life, ​my ​self-taught ​tweaking ​of ​WordPress ​PHP templates ​as ​the managing ​editor ​of ​a ​student ​newspaper transformed ​my ​interest ​into ​a ​career. ​I ​seek roles ​at ​organizations ​who ​share ​my ​passion ​for ​emergent ​technology, ​provide ​solutions ​that improve ​everyone’s ​daily ​life, ​and ​are ​socially ​and environmentally ​conscious ​corporate ​citizens.
