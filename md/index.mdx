# Hello, I’m Anthony.

_Currently, I’m seeking full-time employment in front-end and Node.js development, either remotely or physically in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. Contact me with the information in my [résumé](https://anthony.codes/resume-anthony-maki.pdf) below, or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/4cm4k1/)._

## About me

I’m an adept, mid-level software engineer with rich front and back-end experience across many languages, technologies, and frameworks. I have architected, implemented, and maintained DevOps practices and CI/CD processes in agile startup environments. My specialties include React, Angular, jQuery, and native JavaScript front-end development, Node.js application development, and implementation of development tooling and build processes.

My passion for technology started as latent interest at seven years old when I failed to compile a C++ “Hello World” program. Later in life, my self-taught tweaking of WordPress PHP templates as the managing editor of a student newspaper transformed my interest into a career. I seek roles at organizations who share my passion for emergent technology, provide solutions that improve everyone’s daily life, and are socially and environmentally conscious corporate citizens.
